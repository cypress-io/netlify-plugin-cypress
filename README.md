> Runs Cypress end-to-end tests after Netlify builds the site but before it is deployed

**Note:** currently the built site is served statically and tested _without proxying redirects_.

## Install and use

Enable Netlify Build Plugins Beta from `https://app.netlify.com/teams/<your team name>/enable-beta` the projects that need to use this plugin.

Add `netlify-plugin-cypress` NPM package as a dev dependency to your repository.

```shell
npm install --save-dev netlify-plugin-cypress
# or
yarn add -D netlify-plugin-cypress
```

And then add the plugin's name to the list of build plugins in `netlify.toml` file as shown in the examples below.

*note:* this plugin assumes you have already installed Cypress as a dev NPM dependency.

## Examples

### basic

```toml
# Netlify config file
[build]
command = "npm run build"
publish = "build"

  [build.environment]
  # do not show Cypress installation progress messages
  CI = 1.0
  # cache Cypress binary in local "node_modules" folder
  # so Netlify caches it
  CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER = "./node_modules/CypressBinary"
  # set TERM variable for terminal output
  TERM = "xterm"

[[plugins]]
# local Cypress plugin will test our site after it is built
package = "netlify-plugin-cypress"
```

See [netlify-plugin-cypress-example](https://github.com/cypress-io/netlify-plugin-cypress-example) repo

### recording

To record test results and artifacts on Cypress Dashboard, set `record: true` plugin input and set `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` as an environment variable via Netlify Deploy settings.

```toml
# Netlify config file
[build]
command = "npm run build"
publish = "build"

  [build.environment]
  # do not show Cypress installation progress messages
  CI = 1.0
  # cache Cypress binary in local "node_modules" folder
  # so Netlify caches it
  CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER = "./node_modules/CypressBinary"
  # set TERM variable for terminal output
  TERM = "xterm"

[[plugins]]
# local Cypress plugin will test our site after it is built
package = "netlify-plugin-cypress"

  [plugins.config]
  record = true
```

## Debugging

Set environment variable `DEBUG=netlify-plugin-cypress` to see the debug logs. To see even more information, set `DEBUG=netlify-plugin-cypress,netlify-plugin-cypress:verbose`

## Common problems

<details>
  <summary>Too many progress messages while installing Cypress</summary>
  If you see A LOT of progress messages during "npm install" step, set an environment
  variable during build <code>CI = 1</code> to remove them.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Cypress binary is installed on every build</summary>
  By default Cypress binary is installed in the home folder, see <a href="">caching</a>.
  Netlify build does NOT cache this folder, but it DOES cache the local "node_modules" folder.
  Tell Cypress to install its binary in the "node_modules" folder by setting build environment
  variable <code>CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER = "./node_modules/CypressBinary"</code>.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Cypress binary is missing</summary>
  If you see error messages from `cypress` NPM module <code>Error: The cypress npm package is installed, but the Cypress binary is missing.</code> add to your repository <code>package.json</code> scripts <code>"postinstall": "cypress install"</code> command. See <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/netlify-plugin-cypress-example/blob/master/package.json">netlify-plugin-cypress-example</a> for instance.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Several versions of Cypress are installed according to the build logs</summary>
  From the Netlify UI under Deploys, pick "Trigger Deploy" and select "Clear cache and deploy site". This should cleanly install new "node_modules" and remove old Cypress versions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Term message warnings in the Cypress output</summary>
  If you see messages like <code>tput: No value for $TERM and no -T specified</code> during
  Cypress run, add an environment variable <code>TERM = xterm</code>.
</details>
